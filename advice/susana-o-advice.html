                <h3>Confusion is your friend!</h3>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>
 
                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>
 
                <h3>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h3>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>
 
                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
 
                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

                <h3>Here are a few importat steps that is worth to have a look.</h3>
                <h4>Learn HTML &amp; CSS</h4>
                <p>And become good at it. Why? because the basic matters.</p>
                <p>There are all kinds of different online courses available on how to get started with HTML and CSS. First things first. Sign up at Online courses like Coursera or Team Treehouse. After finishing some initial courses, go ahead and create some static web pages and iterate over and over again.</p>
                <h4>Build things</h4>
                <p>Playing around with (small) UI elements is one thing. Creating an actual landing page or website is something different. At some point, you will eventually start using JavaScript snippets.</p>
                <h4>Do not rush</h4>    
                <p>Along the way, you will ask yourself why you do this and you may want to just stop. It may be tempting to just give up. But don’t. If you’re at that point, I have only one piece of advice for you: Do. not. give. up.</p>
                <h4>Code best practise and ask question</h4>
                <p>Set aside one or two hours every other day to learn. Take a lot of breaks and make sure that you really know the basics. And never rush. Whenever you feel stuck, you'd definitely do, don’t be afraid to ask questions. Everyone goes through this phase.</p>
